# security-perimeter
Build a security perimeter around your home network and guard the important resources at your home

Most home networks have an WiFi Access Point and a Cable Modem / DSL to connect to the Internet. The goal of this project is to setup useful services in the home network and access them securely. Currently these features are supported.

# Docker compose details


* A separate network (home) is configured with a prefix of 172.16.0.0/16 rather than using the dockerâ€™s default network 172.17.0.0/16. Pi-hole container running a dhcp server needs a static IP address that can be used by dhcp-helper to forward the DHCP packets. Trying to assign an IP address from default network does not seem to work

* Dhcp-helper is running in network mode listening on ports 67/68 receiving DHCP packets on the LAN interface and forwarding them to pihole container. Pihole is listening on all interfaces (DNSMASQ_LISTENING: all)

* There are two sets of DNS settings:
    * dns : This tells the container how to resolve DNS queries. Specifying 127.0.0.1 is a requirement which makes locally originating dns requests from within the container go through pi-hole. There is a health check done by pihole by resolving pi-hole (sudo tcpdump -i lo port 53 inside the container will reveal this) and it needs to resolve successfully. See here: https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/issues/431
    * DNS1 and DNS2 are used by pihole as upstream dns servers. This can be changed later from the UI to a different set of servers.
    * DHCP settings specify the address pool and the router. The router address should match the ServerIP the security gateway will be the default router
    * Create a file 07-dhcp-options under etc-dnsmasq.d with the following contents: dhcp-option=option:dns-server,192.168.100.1 (This is required so that the right dns server is returned in DHCP options; otherwise the container address is returned)
    * Caddy settings assumes duckdns and follow the instructions given here: https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Using-Docker-Compose
